## Exercise 1. Wholemeal programming

Reimplement each of the following functions in a more idiomatic
Haskell style. Use wholemeal programming practices, breaking each
function into a pipeline of incremental transformations to an entire
data structure.

fun1
```
fun1 :: [Integer] -> Integer
fun1 [] = 1
fun1 (x:xs)
    | even x    = (x - 2) * fun1 xs
    | otherwise = fun1 x
```

fun2
```
fun2 :: Integer -> Integer
fun2 1 = 0
fun2 n | even n    = n + fun2 (n ‘div‘ 2)
       | otherwise = fun2 (3 * n + 1)
```

Hint: For this problem you may wish to use the functions iterate and takeWhile.
Look them up in the Prelude documentation to see what they do.


## Exercise 2. Folding with trees

Recall the definition of a *binary tree* data structure. The *height*
of a binary tree is the length of a path from the root to the deepest
node. For example, the height of a tree with a single node is 0; the
height of a tree with three nodes, whose root has two children, is 1;
and so on. A binary tree is balanced if the height of its left and
right subtrees differ by no more than 1, and its left and right
subtrees are also balanced.

You should use the following data structure to represent binary trees.
Note that each node stores an extra Integer representing the
height at that node.

```
data Tree a = Leaf
    | Node Integer (Tree a) a (Tree a)
    deriving (Show, Eq)
```

For this exercise, write a function

```
foldTree :: [a] -> Tree a
foldTree = ..
```

which generates a balanced binary tree from a list of values using foldr.

For example, one sample output might be the following:

```
foldTree "ABCDEFGHIJ" ==
  Node 3
    (Node 2
      (Node 0 Leaf ’F’ Leaf)
      ’I’
      (Node 1 (Node 0 Leaf ’B’ Leaf) ’C’ Leaf))
    ’J’
    (Node 2
      (Node 1 (Node 0 Leaf ’A’ Leaf) ’G’ Leaf)
      ’H’
      (Node 1 (Node 0 Leaf ’D’ Leaf) ’E’ Leaf)
```
    J
   / \
  I   H
 / \ / \
F  C G  E
  / /  /
 B A  D

Your solution might not place the nodes in the same exact order,
but it should result in balanced trees, with each subtree having a
correct computed height.


## Exercise 3. More folds!

1. Implement a function

```
xor :: [Bool] -> Bool
```

which returns True if and only if there are an odd number of True
values contained in the input list. It does not matter how many False
values the input list contains. For example,

```
xor [False, True, False] == True
xor [False, True, False, False, True] == False
```

Your solution must be implemented using a fold.


2. Implement map as a fold. That is, complete the definition

```
map’ :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map’ f = foldr ...
```

in such a way that map’ behaves identically to the standard map function.


3. Implement foldl using foldr. That is, complete the definition

```
myFoldl :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
myFoldl f base xs = foldr ...
```

in such a way that myFoldl behaves identically to the standard foldl function.

Hint: Study how the application of foldr and foldl work out:

```
foldr f z [x1, x2, ..., xn] == x1 ‘f‘ (x2 ‘f‘ ... (xn ‘f‘ z)...)
foldl f z [x1, x2, ..., xn] == (...((z ‘f‘ x1) ‘f‘ x2) ‘f‘...) ‘f‘ xn
```

## Exercise 4. Finding primes

Read about the Sieve of Sundaram
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Sundaram

Implement the algorithm using function composition. Given an integer n,
your function should generate all the odd prime numbers up to 2n + 2.

```
sieveSundaram :: Integer -> [Integer]
sieveSundaram = ...
```

To give you some help, below is a function to compute the Cartesian
product of two lists. This is similar to zip, but it produces all
possible pairs instead of matching up the list elements. For example,

```
cartProd [1,2] [’a’,’b’] == [(1,’a’),(1,’b’),(2,’a’),(2,’b’)]
```

It’s written using a list comprehension

```
cartProd :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]
cartProd xs ys = [(x,y) | x <- xs, y <- ys]
```
