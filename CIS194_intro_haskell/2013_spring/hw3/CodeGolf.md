# Code Golf

Write code as short as possible.

Do not count towards the length of your solutions:
- Comments
- Type signatures
- Import statement
- Whitespace

You may want to start by getting something that works, without
worrying about the length. Once you have solved the task, try to
figure out ways to make your solution shorter.


## Exercise 1. Hopscotch

Your first task is to write a function
```
skips :: [a] -> [[a]]
```

The output of skips is a list of lists. The first list in the output
should be the same as the input list. The second list in the output
should contain every second element from the input list ... and the
nth list in the output should contain every nth element from the input
list.

For example:
```
skips "ABCD"       == ["ABCD", "BD", "C", "D"]
skips "hello!"     == ["hello!", "el!", "l!", "l", "o", "!"]
skips [1]          == [[1]]
skips [True,False] == [[True,False], [False]]
skips []           == []
```

Note that the output should be the same length as the input.


## Exercise 2. Local maxima

A local maximum of a list is an element of the list which is strictly
greater than both the elements immediately before and after it. For
example, in the list [2,3,4,1,5], the only local maximum is 4, since
it is greater than the elements immediately before and after it (3 and
1). 5 is not a local maximum since there is no element that comes
after it.

Write a function
```
localMaxima :: [Integer] -> [Integer]
```
which finds all the local maxima in the input list and returns them in order.

For example:
```
localMaxima [2,9,5,6,1] == [9,6]
localMaxima [2,3,4,1,5] == [4]
localMaxima [1,2,3,4,5] == []
```


## Exercise 3. Histogram

For this task, write a function
```
histogram :: [Integer] -> String
```
which takes as input a list of Integer s between 0 and 9 (inclusive),
and outputs a vertical histogram showing how many of each number were
in the input list. You may assume that the input list does not contain
any numbers less than zero or greater than 9 (that is, it does not
matter what your function does if the input does contain such
numbers). Your output must exactly match the output shown in the
examples below.

```
histogram [0,0,0,4] ==
*
*
*   *
==========
0123456789
```

```
histogram [0,4,8,1,2,0,3,2,0,5,0]
*
*
* *
******  *
==========
0123456789
```

Important note: If you type something like histogram [3,5] at the ghci
prompt, you should see something like this:
```
"   * *    \n==========\n0123456789\n
```
